# Dot Pop

[Idea taken from Web Dev Junkie:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BmLYHLPZs)

- Click anywhere on the page and then add a circle to that position
- Buttons to undo/redo

## Playing around with React, some key topics/lessons

- queueing system for undo/redo
- how to use the "html-to-image" module for screenshots (that render correctly)
- keyframes for CSS animation (matches experience in After Effects)
- setting the vertical height to be in the bounds of the viewport for mobile `height: calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100);`
- don't initiate a function if the target is a button
