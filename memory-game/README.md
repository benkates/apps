# Memory Game

Things I've learned:

- tricky queuing system logic for what's been clicked/matched/not matched
- the `border` CSS attribute is shorthand for width, style, color
- created a timer hook
- wrestled with CSS centering for the timer output
- experimented with background images for divs
- experimented with animated backgrounds (rainbow)
