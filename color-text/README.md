# Color Text

This is an original idea I've had for a bit, messing around in React:

- exploring the "use-fit-text" module to change the size of the input text dynamically
- exploring the "seedrandom" module to get a seeded random function for the color-defining string
- using the `white-space` CSS attribute to set the `<textarea>` style to one line
- removing the `spellcheck` HTML attribute from the input to remove red lines
